# Comparable

My work on Mr. Holmes' [hw5C](http://davidmholmes.net/Stuy/ap/hw.html#5C), a homework assignment on interfaces.

This repo includes:

 - A `Date` class that implements `Comparable`, representing a year, month, and day.
 - A `Point` class that implements `Comparable`, representing a point in the Cartesian plane.
 - A `Dog` class that does not implement `Comparable`, representing a canine pet.
 - A `UserOfComparable` class that compares the `Comparable` classes.
